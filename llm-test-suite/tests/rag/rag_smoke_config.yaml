      Vue.js Composition API is a set of additive, function-based APIs that allow flexible composition of component logic.
      It provides better logic reuse and more flexible code organization compared to Options API.
      The main functions include: ref() for reactive state, reactive() for reactive objects, computed() for computed properties,
      watch() and watchEffect() for side effects, and lifecycle hooks like onMounted() and onUnmounted().

      Vue's reactivity system works by tracking property access and mutations. When you read a reactive property,
      it gets tracked as a dependency. When you change a reactive property, it triggers updates to any effects that depend on it.
      Vue 3 uses Proxies for reactivity, which allows it to intercept all property access and mutations.
      ref() creates a reactive reference with a .value property, while reactive() makes an entire object reactive.

      Components are the building blocks of Vue applications. A component is a reusable Vue instance with a name.
      Single-File Components (SFC) use the .vue extension and combine template, script, and style in one file.
      Components can receive data via props and emit events to communicate with parent components.
      The <script setup> syntax provides a more concise way to define component logic in Composition API.
